To launch the tool open the file called "index.html" inside of your javascript enabled web browser.
To do this you can right click the file and "open with" your web browser, or you can type "file://FILE_PATH"
into the search bar. (Replace FILE_PATH with the path to "index.html")

To move characters simply click the selectors/pickers on the left sidebar and change the character with the given options.

This tool was created by Falco_DJ, some reusable code was  recycled from the "legecy te stagelist tool," 
and many titles and/or names for peices of code were also reused (or changed slightly) from the same tool.

The ASM wiird code "CSS Roster Data" was created by spunit262, and "CSS Random Data" was created by ds22, and dantarion.
The UI is was taken from the legacy te stagelist tool, that was based off of SOJ's stagelist tool's UI; the background, the logo, and the colors are new.

To make the tool compatible with any Project M 3.6 and Knuckles build (NOT INCLUDING PMEX) click the "+ Knuckles" button on the left side of the screen.
The button "+ Knuckes" will not toggle Knuckles into your project m mod, its only purpose is to toggle Knuckles into the tool.

Once you have your desireable layout, generate your codes, with the "Generate Codes" button, and replace the existing "CSS Roster Data" and "CSS Random Data" 
In your RSBE01.gct with the new ones you generated.

By using this tool you agree that, I am not responsible for anything that might happen to your project m build.
I recomend that you backup your old gct, and that you also backup your project m build itself.
